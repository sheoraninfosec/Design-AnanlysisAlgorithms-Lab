## 🧮 Overview  
This repository contains all the lab code and notes from my _M.Sc. Cyber Security – Semester 1_ course focused on **Design & Analysis of Algorithms**.  
Each folder/project implements a core algorithm (sorting, search, graph, encoding, etc.) using Python or C++, with clear comments and submission-ready style.
