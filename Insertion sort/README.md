# 🔢 Insertion Sort Algorithm

### ⏱ Time Complexity

- Best Case (Already Sorted): O(n)
- Worst Case (Reverse Order): O(n²)
- Space Complexity: O(1)

## 🧠 Algorithm

1. Assume the first element is already sorted.
2. Pick the next element (key).
3. Compare it with elements in the sorted portion.
4. Shift elements that are greater than key.
5. Insert the key in its correct position.
6. Repeat until the list is fully sorted.

```
Enter number of elements:
6

Enter elements:
12 11 13 5 6 7
```

## ✅ Sample Output

```
Sorted List:
[5, 6, 7, 11, 12, 13]
```
